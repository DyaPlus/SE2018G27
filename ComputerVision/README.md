# Computer Vision
<p>It consist of 2 parts to make Artificial Intelligence Prototype for our website </p>

* [**ID Recognition**](https://github.com/DyaPlus/SE2018G27/tree/master/ComputerVision/OCR) – This is a work in progress for the OCR, we will then use to authenticate the national ID , all you need to do is to install the tesseract-OCR to use this , and then use pytesseract .
* [**Face ID**](https://github.com/DyaPlus/SE2018G27/tree/master/ComputerVision/face%20id) – This part that will take database of pictures of workers and will fill the attendance sheet automatic everyday by recognizing faces of them , the implementation here is just prototype and may have bad accuracy because it need to be work on GPU not CPU  .
